The Club has four "Policlay" synthetic tennis courts, all equipped with floodlights for night play. All ages and standards are catered for whether playing tennis socially or competitively. Whilst Canterbury Tennis Club has a proud ongoing participation in affiliated competitions, regular social tennis events are also held throughout the year to encourage recreational tennis. Additionally, coaching by [Nima Tennis](coaching) is available during the week for those desiring to improve their tennis.
